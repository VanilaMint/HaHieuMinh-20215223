1. Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
-Store and Cart contains multiple instance of media classes and CompactDisc contains multiple Disc
2. If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens? 
-if the passing object is not an instance of Media the method will return false
3.What class should implement the Comparable interface?
-The Media class should implement the interface.
4.In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo( )method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
-it should returns and interger: 0 when both are equal, <0 when the current object is less than and >0 when the current object is greater.
5.Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach? 
-No
6.Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this? 
-we can overwrite the compareTo() method to achive this.
